# remote_car
I have provided comments wherever I deemed them necessary. Other than that the code is self explanatory. I have also provided
the startup_ccs.c file which is the interrupt vector table necessary to use the appropriate interrupt number. 
I have used UART module 2 on the launchpad which is interrupt no. 33 to receive the bluetooth data from HC-05 bluetooth module 
which is used in receive mode.
